# Placement Prediction

This project aims to predict student placement outcomes based on CGPA and IQ using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The implementation is carried out primarily using Jupyter Notebooks.

  

## Introduction
The `Placement_Prediction` project explores patterns in student data to predict placement possibilities based on various factors such as academic performance, skills, and other attributes. This can assist institutions and students in identifying key areas for improvement and better preparation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Visualizations to understand key insights from the data

## Technologies Used
This project uses the following technologies:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
  - **pandas**: For data manipulation.
  - **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
